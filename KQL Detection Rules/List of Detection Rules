Before I setup log forwarding, I first need to ensure that my Splunk server is set up to actually receive logs. Specifically, I need to make sure that:
1. The correct ports are open in the Splunk/Ubuntu EC2 security group for log traffic
2. Setup my Splunk account to receive logs from sysmon and windows AD logs.
3. Enable HTTP Event Collector (HEC) so that AWS logs can be forwarded to Splunk
4. Install "Splunk Add Ons" for AWS services and Microsoft Windows so that Splunk can properly parse these logs.
